A project that can use several different algorithms to solve a maze.
these algorithms are:
1. DFS
2. BFS
3. UCS
4. Greedy
5. A*

- The maze can be either a 2D maze or a 3D maze.

- Each cell in the maze can either be a wall (represented by #), the start of the maze (represented by S), 
  the end of the maze (represented by E) or a number which represents the number of steps that can be taken 
  starting from this cell.

- If the maze is a 3D maze it can also have an up ladder (represented by A) and a down ladder (represented by D)

A sample of the results:
